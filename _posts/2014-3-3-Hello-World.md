title: My first week at Metis!
---

My first week at Metis is behind me. Our cohort hit the ground running by jumping straight in to our first project, Benson.

After splitting in to groups of four, we were tasked with making recommendations to a client who wanted to know the best subway stations to canvas for an upcoming Gala.

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
